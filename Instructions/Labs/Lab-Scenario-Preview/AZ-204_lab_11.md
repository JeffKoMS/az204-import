# Lab Scenario Preview - 11 - Monitor services that are deployed to Azure

## Lab overview
In this lab, you will create an Application Insights resource in Azure that will be used to monitor and log application insight data for later review. The API will be set to automatically scale if demand increases to a certain threshold and logging the data will help determine how the service is being utilized.
