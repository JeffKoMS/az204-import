# Lab Scenario Preview - 02 - Implement task processing logic by using Azure Functions

## Lab overview
In this lab, you will demonstrate the ability to create a simple Azure function that echoes text that is entered and sent to the function by using HTTP POST commands. This will illustrate how the function can be triggered over HTTP.

Additionally, you will demonstrate how to execute an Azure function by setting it to execute on a fixed schedule. The function will write a message to a log each time the schedule is triggered.

Finally, you will demonstrate how an Azure function can connect to other Azure resources, such as a storage account. The function will connect to a storage account that you create and return the contents of a file that is stored in the Azure storage account.

## Objective
In this lab, you will perform:
+ Exercise 1: Create Azure resources
    + Task 1: Open the Azure portal
    + Task 2: Create an Azure Storage account
    + Task 3: Create a function app
+ Exercise 2: Configure a local Azure Functions project
    + Task 1: Initialize a function project
    + Task 2: Configure a connection string
    + Task 3: Build and validate a project
+ Exercise 3: Create a function that's triggered by an HTTP request
    + Task 1: Create an HTTP-triggered function
    + Task 2: Write HTTP-triggered function code
    + Task 3: Test the HTTP-triggered function by using httprepl
+ Exercise 4: Create a function that triggers on a schedule
    + Task 1: Create a schedule-triggered function
    + Task 2: Observe function code
    + Task 3: Observe function runs
    + Task 4: Update the function integration configuration
    + Task 5: Observe function runs
+ Exercise 5: Create a function that integrates with other services
    + Task 1: Upload sample content to Azure Blob Storage
    + Task 2: Create an HTTP-triggered function
    + Task 3: Write HTTP-triggered and blob-inputted function code
    + Task 4: Register Azure Storage Blob extensions
    + Task 5: Test the function by using httprepl
+ Exercise 6: Deploy a local function project to an Azure Functions app
    + Task 1: Deploy using the Azure Functions Core Tools
    + Task 2: Validate deployment
